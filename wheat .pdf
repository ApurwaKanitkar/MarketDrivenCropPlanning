Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple food. The 
many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum (/ˈtrɪtɪkəm/); the most widely 
grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first 
cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC. Botanically, the wheat kernel is 
a caryopsis, a type of fruit.
Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.7 million hectares or 545 
million acres in 2021). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 
2021, world wheat production was 771 million tonnes (850 million short tons), making it the 
second most-produced cereal after maize (known as corn in the US and Australia; wheat is 
often called corn in other countries). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain 
crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global 
demand for wheat is increasing because of the usefulness of gluten to the food industry.
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable 
proteins in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high 
compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality (supplying essential amino 
acids). When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber. 
In a small part of the general population, gluten – which comprises most of the protein in wheat 
– can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis 
herpetiformis.

A: Plant; B ripe ear of corn; 1 spikelet before flowering; 2 the same, flowering and spread, 
enlarged; 3 flowers with glumes; 4 stamens 5 pollen; 6 and 7 ovaries with juice scales; 8 and 9 
parts of the scar; 10 fruit husks; 11, 12, 13 seeds, natural size and enlarged; 14 the same cut up, 
enlarged.
Wheat is a stout grass of medium to tall height. Its stem is jointed and usually hollow, forming a 
straw. There can be many stems on one plant. It has long narrow leaves, their bases sheathing 
the stem, one above each joint. At the top of the stem is the flower head, containing some 20 to 
100 flowers. Each flower contains both male and female parts. The flower, which is windpollinated, is housed in a pair of small leaflike glumes. The two (male) stamens and (female) 
stigmas protrude outside the glumes. The flowers are grouped into spikelets, each with between 
two and six flowers. Each fertilised carpel develops into a wheat grain or berry; botanically a 
fruit, it is often called a seed. The grains ripen to a golden yellow; a head of grain is called an ear.
Leaves emerge from the shoot apical meristem in a telescoping fashion until the transition to 
reproduction i.e. flowering. The last leaf produced by a wheat plant is known as the flag leaf. It is 
denser and has a higher photosynthetic rate than other leaves, to supply carbohydrate to the 
developing ear. In temperate countries the flag leaf, along with the second and third highest leaf 
on the plant, supply the majority of carbohydrate in the grain and their condition is paramount to 
yield formation. Wheat is unusual among plants in having more stomata on the upper (adaxial) 
side of the leaf, than on the under (abaxial) side. It has been theorised that this might be an 
effect of it having been domesticated and cultivated longer than any other plant. Winter wheat 
generally produces up to 15 leaves per shoot and spring wheat up to 9 and winter crops may 
have up to 35 tillers (shoots) per plant (depending on cultivar).
Wheat roots are among the deepest of arable crops, extending as far down as 2 metres (6 ft 7 
in). While the roots of a wheat plant are growing, the plant also accumulates an energy store in 
its stem, in the form of fructans, which helps the plant to yield under drought and disease 
pressure, but it has been observed that there is a trade-off between root growth and stem nonstructural carbohydrate reserves. Root growth is likely to be prioritised in drought-adapted 
crops, while stem non-structural carbohydrate is prioritised in varieties developed for countries 
where disease is a bigger issue.
Depending on variety, wheat may be awned or not awned. Producing awns incurs a cost in grain 
number, but wheat awns photosynthesise more efficiently than their leaves with regards to 
water usage, so awns are much more frequent in varieties of wheat grown in hot drought-prone 
countries than those generally seen in temperate countries. For this reason, awned varieties 
could become more widely grown due to climate change. In Europe, however, a decline in 
climate resilience of wheat has been observed.

Domestication
Further information: Domestication
Hunter-gatherers in West Asia harvested wild wheats for thousands of years before they were 
domesticated, perhaps as early as 21,000 BC, but they formed a minor component of their 
diets. This phase of pre-domestication cultivation lasted at least a thousand years, during which 
early cultivars were spread around the region and slowly developed the traits that would come 
to characterise their domesticated forms.
Repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the creation of domestic 
strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat were more amenable to cultivation. In domesticated 
wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a 
toughened rachis during harvesting. In wild strains, a more fragile rachis allows the ear to 
shatter easily, dispersing the spikelets. Selection for larger grains and non-shattering heads by 
farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply have occurred because these 
traits made gathering the seeds easier; nevertheless such 'incidental' selection was an 
important part of crop domestication. As the traits that improve wheat as a food source involve 
the loss of the plant's natural seed dispersal mechanisms, highly domesticated strains of wheat 
cannot survive in the wild.
Wild einkorn wheat (T. monococcum subsp. boeoticum) grows across Southwest Asia in open 
parkland and steppe environments. It comprises three distinct races, only one of which, native 
to Southeast Anatolia, was domesticated. The main feature that distinguishes domestic einkorn 
from wild is that its ears do not shatter without pressure, making it dependent on humans for 
dispersal and reproduction. It also tends to have wider grains. Wild einkorn was collected at 
sites such as Tell Abu Hureyra (c. 10,700–9000 BC) and Mureybet (c. 9800–9300 BC), but the 
earliest archaeological evidence for the domestic form comes after c.  8800 BC in southern 
Turkey, at Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, and possibly Nevalı Çori. Genetic evidence indicates that it was 
domesticated in multiple places independently.
Wild emmer wheat (T. turgidum subsp. dicoccoides) is less widespread than einkorn, favouring 
the rocky basaltic and limestone soils found in the hilly flanks of the Fertile Crescent. It is more 
diverse, with domesticated varieties falling into two major groups: hulled or non-shattering, in 
which threshing separates the whole spikelet; and free-threshing, where the individual grains 
are separated. Both varieties probably existed in prehistory, but over time free-threshing 
cultivars became more common. Wild emmer was first cultivated in the southern Levant, as 
early as 9600 BC. Genetic studies have found that, like einkorn, it was domesticated in 
southeastern Anatolia, but only once. The earliest secure archaeological evidence for domestic 
emmer comes from Çayönü, c. 8300–7600 BC, where distinctive scars on the spikelets 
indicated that they came from a hulled domestic variety. Slightly earlier finds have been 
reported from Tell Aswad in Syria, c. 8500–8200 BC, but these were identified using a less 
reliable method based on grain size.
Early farming
Sickles with stone microblades were used to harvest wheat in the Neolithic period, c. 8500–
4000 BC
Einkorn and emmer are considered two of the founder crops cultivated by the first farming 
societies in Neolithic West Asia. These communities also cultivated naked wheats (T. aestivum 
and T. durum) and a now-extinct domesticated form of Zanduri wheat (T. timopheevii), as well as 
a wide variety of other cereal and non-cereal crops. Wheat was relatively uncommon for the 
first thousand years of the Neolithic (when barley predominated), but became a staple after 
around 8500 BC. Early wheat cultivation did not demand much labour. Initially, farmers took 
advantage of wheat's ability to establish itself in annual grasslands by enclosing fields against 
grazing animals and re-sowing stands after they had been harvested, without the need to 
systematically remove vegetation or till the soil. They may also have exploited natural wetlands 
and floodplains to practice décrue farming, sowing seeds in the soil left behind by receding 
floodwater. It was harvested with stone-bladed sickles. The ease of storing wheat and other 
cereals led farming households to become gradually more reliant on it over time, especially 
after they developed individual storage facilities that were large enough to hold more than a 
year's supply.
Wheat grain was stored after threshing, with the chaff removed. It was then processed into flour 
using ground stone mortars. Bread made from ground einkorn and the tubers of a form of club 
rush (Bolboschoenus glaucus) was made as early as 12,400 BC. At Çatalhöyük (c. 7100–6000 
BC), both wholegrain wheat and flour was used to prepare bread, porridge and gruel. Apart from 
food, wheat may also have been important to Neolithic societies as a source of straw, which 
could be used for fuel, wicker-making, or wattle and daub construction.
Spread
Domestic wheat was quickly spread to regions where its wild ancestors did not grow naturally. 
Emmer was introduced to Cyprus as early as 8600 BC and einkorn c. 7500 BC; emmer reached 
Greece by 6500 BC, Egypt shortly after 6000 BC, and Germany and Spain by 5000 BC."The early 
Egyptians were developers of bread and the use of the oven and developed baking into one of 
the first large-scale food production industries." By 4000 BC, wheat had reached the British Isles 
and Scandinavia. Wheat likely appeared in China's lower Yellow River around 2600 BC.
The oldest evidence for hexaploid wheat has been confirmed through DNA analysis of wheat 
seeds, dating to around 6400–6200 BC, recovered from Çatalhöyük. As of 2023, the earliest 
known wheat with sufficient gluten for yeasted breads was found in a granary at Assiros in 
Macedonia dated to 1350 BC. From the Middle East, wheat continued to spread across Europe 
and to the Americas in the Columbian exchange. In the British Isles, wheat straw (thatch) was 
used for roofing in the Bronze Age, and remained in common use until the late 19th century.
White wheat bread was historically a high status food, but during the nineteenth century it 
became in Britain an item of mass consumption, displacing oats, barley and rye from diets in 
the North of the country. It became "a sign of a high degree of culture". After 1860, the enormous 
expansion of wheat production in the United States flooded the world market, lowering prices 
by 40%, and (along with the expansion of potato growing) made a major contribution to the 
nutritional welfare of the poor.

Evolution
Phylogeny
Wheat origins by repeated hybridization and polyploidy. Not all species are shown.
Some wheat species are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, but many are stable 
polyploids, with four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid). Einkorn wheat 
(Triticum monococcum) is diploid (AA, two complements of seven chromosomes, 2n=14). Most 
tetraploid wheats (e.g. emmer and durum wheat) are derived from wild emmer, T. dicoccoides. 
Wild emmer is itself the result of a hybridization between two diploid wild grasses, T. urartu and 
a wild goatgrass such as Ae. speltoides. The hybridization that formed wild emmer (AABB, four 
complements of seven chromosomes in two groups, 4n=28) occurred in the wild, long before 
domestication, and was driven by natural selection. Hexaploid wheats evolved in farmers' fields 
as wild emmer hybridized with another goatgrass, Ae. squarrosa or Ae. tauschii, to make the 
hexaploid wheats including bread wheat.
A 2007 molecular phylogeny of the wheats gives the following not fully-resolved cladogram of 
major cultivated species; the large amount of hybridisation makes resolution difficult. Markings 
like "6N" indicate the degree of polyploidy of each species:
Taxonomy
During 10,000 years of cultivation, numerous forms of wheat, many of them hybrids, have 
developed under a combination of artificial and natural selection. This complexity and diversity 
of status has led to much confusion in the naming of wheats.
Major species
Hexaploid species (6N)
Common wheat or bread wheat (T. aestivum) – The most widely cultivated species in the world.
Spelt (T. spelta) – Another species largely replaced by bread wheat, but in the 21st century 
grown, often organically, for artisanal bread and pasta.
Tetraploid species (4N)
Durum (T. durum) – A wheat widely used today, and the second most widely cultivated wheat.
Emmer (T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum and T. t. conv. durum) – A species cultivated in ancient 
times, derived from wild emmer, T. dicoccoides, but no longer in widespread use.
Khorasan or Kamut (T. turgidum ssp. turanicum, also called T. turanicum) is an ancient grain 
type; Khorasan is a historical region in modern-day Afghanistan and the northeast of Iran. The 
grain is twice the size of modern wheat and has a rich nutty flavor.
Diploid species (2N)
Einkorn (T. monococcum). Domesticated from wild einkorn, T. boeoticum, at the same time as 
emmer wheat.
Hulled versus free-threshing species
Hulled wheat & Einkorn. Note how the einkorn ear breaks down into intact spikelets.
The four wild species of wheat, along with the domesticated varieties einkorn, emmer and spelt,
have hulls. This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened 
glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that 
breaks easily on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into 
spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to 
remove the hulls or husks. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened 
glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain. In free-threshing (or naked) forms, 
such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On 
threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains.
As a food
Naming of grain classes
Wheat grain classes are named by color, season, and hardness. The classes used in the United 
States are:
Durum – Hard, translucent, light-colored grain used to make semolina flour for pasta and 
bulghur; high in protein, specifically, gluten protein.
Hard Red Spring – Hard, brownish, high-protein wheat used for bread and hard baked goods. 
Bread flour and high-gluten flours are commonly made from hard red spring wheat. It is 
primarily traded on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.
Hard Red Winter – Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat used for bread, hard baked goods 
and as an adjunct in other flours to increase protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands 
of unbleached all-purpose flours are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is 
primarily traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade. Many varieties grown from Kansas south are 
descendant from a variety known as "turkey red", which was brought to Kansas by Mennonite 
immigrants from Russia. Marquis wheat was developed to prosper in the shorter growing 
season in Canada, and is grown as far south as southern Nebraska.
Soft Red Winter – Soft, low-protein wheat used for cakes, pie crusts, biscuits, and muffins. Cake 
flour, pastry flour, and some self-rising flours with baking powder and salt added, for example, 
are made from soft red winter wheat. It is primarily traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Hard White – Hard, light-colored, opaque, chalky, medium-protein wheat planted in dry, 
temperate areas. Used for bread and brewing.
Soft White – Soft, light-colored, very low protein wheat grown in temperate moist areas. Used 
for pie crusts and pastry.

Wheat is a staple cereal worldwide. Raw wheat berries can be ground into flour or, using hard 
durum wheat only, can be ground into semolina; germinated and dried creating malt; crushed or 
cut into cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into bulgur also 
known as groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer 
husk or bran can be used in several ways. Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, 
porridge, crackers, biscuits, muesli, pancakes, pasta, pies, pastries, pizza, semolina, cakes, 
cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza (a fermented beverage), and 
breakfast cereals. In manufacturing wheat products, gluten is valuable to impart viscoelastic 
functional qualities in dough, enabling the preparation of diverse processed foods such as 
breads, noodles, and pasta that facilitate wheat consumption.
Nutrition
Raw red winter wheat is 13% water, 71% carbohydrates including 12% dietary fiber, 13% 
protein, and 2% fat (table). Some 75–80% of the protein content is as gluten. In a reference 
amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), wheat provides 1,368 kilojoules (327 kilocalories) of food energy 
and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of multiple dietary minerals, such as 
manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, and iron (table). The B vitamins, niacin (36% DV), 
thiamine (33% DV), and vitamin B6 (23% DV), are present in significant amounts (table).
Wheat is a significant source of vegetable proteins in human food, having a relatively high 
protein content compared to other major cereals. However, wheat proteins have a low quality 
for human nutrition, according to the DIAAS protein quality evaluation method. Though they 
contain adequate amounts of the other essential amino acids, at least for adults, wheat 
proteins are deficient in the essential amino acid lysine. Because the proteins present in the 
wheat endosperm (gluten proteins) are particularly poor in lysine, white flours are more 
deficient in lysine compared with whole grains. Significant efforts in plant breeding are made to 
develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without success, as of 2017. Supplementation with proteins 
from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency,
since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and 
become excreted, which is especially important during growth.
Health advisories
Consumed worldwide by billions of people, wheat is a significant food for human nutrition, 
particularly in the least developed countries where wheat products are primary foods. When 
eaten as the whole grain, wheat supplies multiple nutrients and dietary fiber recommended for 
children and adults. In genetically susceptible people, wheat gluten can trigger coeliac disease.
Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the general population in developed countries. The only 
known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. While coeliac disease is caused by 
a reaction to wheat proteins, it is not the same as a wheat allergy. Other diseases triggered by 
eating wheat are non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (estimated to affect 0.5% to 13% of the general 
population), gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Certain short-chain carbohydrates 
present in wheat, known as FODMAPs (mainly fructose polymers), may be the cause of noncoeliac gluten sensitivity. As of 2019, reviews have concluded that FODMAPs only explain 
certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but not the extra-digestive symptoms that 
people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity may develop health disorders. Other wheat proteins, 
amylase-trypsin inhibitors, have been identified as the possible activator of the innate immune 
system in coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. These proteins are part of the 
plant's natural defence against insects and may cause intestinal inflammation in humans.

World 771
In 2021, world wheat production was 771 million tonnes, led by China, India, and Russia which 
collectively provided 42% of the world total. As of 2019, the largest exporters were Russia (32 
million tonnes), United States (27), Canada (23) and France (20), while the largest importers 
were Indonesia (11 million tonnes), Egypt (10.4) and Turkey (10.0). In 2021, wheat was grown on 
220.7 million hectares or 545 million acres worldwide, more than any other food crop. World 
trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. Global demand for wheat is 
increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which 
facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the 
worldwide industrialization process and westernization of diets.
Historical factors
Wheat prices in England, 1264–1996
Wheat became a central agriculture endeavor in the worldwide British Empire in the 19th 
century, and remains of great importance in Australia, Canada and India. In Australia, with vast 
lands and a limited work force, expanded production depended on technological advances, 
especially regarding irrigation and machinery. By the 1840s there were 900 growers in South 
Australia. They used "Ridley's Stripper", to remove the heads of grain, a reaper-harvester 
perfected by John Ridley in 1843. In Canada, modern farm implements made large scale wheat 
farming possible from the late 1840s. By 1879, Saskatchewan was the center, followed by 
Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, as the spread of railway lines allowed easy exports to Britain. By 
1910, wheat made up 22% of Canada's exports, rising to 25% in 1930 despite the sharp decline 
in prices during the worldwide Great Depression. Efforts to expand wheat production in South 
Africa, Kenya and India were stymied by low yields and disease. However, by 2000 India had 
become the second largest producer of wheat in the world. In the 19th century the American 
wheat frontier moved rapidly westward. By the 1880s 70% of American exports went to British 
ports. The first successful grain elevator was built in Buffalo in 1842. The cost of transport fell 
rapidly. In 1869 it cost 37 cents to transport a bushel of wheat from Chicago to Liverpool. In 
1905 it was 10 cents.
In the 20th century, global wheat output expanded by about 5-fold, but until about 1955 most of 
this reflected increases in wheat crop area, with lesser (about 20%) increases in crop yields per 
unit area. After 1955 however, there was a ten-fold increase in the rate of wheat yield 
improvement per year, and this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to 
increase. Thus technological innovation and scientific crop management with synthetic 
nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output growth in 
the second half of the century. There were some significant decreases in wheat crop area, for 
instance in North America. Better seed storage and germination ability (and hence a smaller 
requirement to retain harvested crop for next year's seed) is another 20th-century technological 
innovation. In Medieval England, farmers saved one-quarter of their wheat harvest as seed for
the next crop, leaving only three-quarters for food and feed consumption. By 1999, the global 
average seed use of wheat was about 6% of output. In the 21st century, rising temperatures 
associated with global warming are reducing wheat yield in several locations.
Peak wheat
Food production per person increased since 1961.
Peak wheat is the concept that agricultural production, due to its high use of water and energy 
inputs, is subject to the same profile as oil and other fossil fuel production. The central tenet is 
that a point is reached, the "peak", beyond which agricultural production plateaus and does not 
grow any further, and may even go into permanent decline.
Based on current supply and demand factors for agricultural commodities (e.g., changing diets 
in the emerging economies, biofuels, declining acreage under irrigation, growing global 
population, stagnant agricultural productivity growth), some commentators are predicting a 
long-term annual production shortfall of around 2% which, based on the highly inelastic 
demand curve for food crops, could lead to sustained price increases in excess of 10% a year –
sufficient to double crop prices in seven years.
According to the World Resources Institute, global per capita food production has been 
increasing substantially for the past several decades.
Agronomy
Growing wheat
Wheat is an annual crop. It can be planted in autumn and harvested in early summer as winter 
wheat in climates that are not too severe, or planted in spring and harvested in autumn as 
spring wheat. It is normally planted after tilling the soil by ploughing and then harrowing to kill 
weeds and create an even surface. The seeds are then scattered on the surface, or drilled into 
the soil in rows. Winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze. It needs to develop to a height 
of 10 to 15 cm before the cold intervenes, so as to be able to survive the winter; it requires a 
period with the temperature at or near freezing, its dormancy then being broken by the thaw or 
rise in temperature. Spring wheat does not undergo dormancy. Wheat requires a deep soil, 
preferably a loam with organic matter, and available minerals including soil nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and potassium. An acid and peaty soil is not suitable. Wheat needs some 30 to 38 
cm of rain in the growing season to form a good crop of grain.
The farmer may intervene while the crop is growing to add fertilizer, water by irrigation, or 
pesticides such as herbicides to kill broad-leaved weeds or insecticides to kill insect pests. The 
farmer may assess soil minerals, soil water, weed growth, or the arrival of pests to decide timely 
and cost-effective corrective actions, and crop ripeness and water content to select the right 
moment to harvest. Harvesting involves reaping, cutting the stems to gather the crop; and 
threshing, breaking the ears to release the grain; both steps are carried out by a combine 
harvester. The grain is then dried so that it can be stored safe from mould fungi.
Crop development
Wheat developmental stages on the BBCH and Zadok's scales
Wheat normally needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, depending 
upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions. Optimal crop management requires that the 
farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In 
particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied 
only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the 
second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1 cm 
in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages is also important to identify periods of higher 
risk from the climate. Farmers benefit from knowing when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as 
this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so 
should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield. Several systems 
exist to identify crop stages, with the Feekes and Zadoks scales being the most widely used. 
Each scale is a standard system which describes successive stages reached by the crop during 
the agricultural season. For example, the stage of pollen formation from the mother cell, and 
the stages between anthesis and maturity, are susceptible to high temperatures, and this 
adverse effect is made worse by water stress.
Farming techniques
Technological advances in soil preparation and seed placement at planting time, use of crop 
rotation and fertilizers to improve plant growth, and advances in harvesting methods have all 
combined to promote wheat as a viable crop. When the use of seed drills replaced broadcasting 
sowing of seed in the 18th century, another great increase in productivity occurred. Yields of 
pure wheat per unit area increased as methods of crop rotation were applied to land that had 
long been in cultivation, and the use of fertilizers became widespread.
Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included pervasive automation, starting 
with the use of threshing machines, and progressing to large and costly machines like the 
combine harvester which greatly increased productivity. At the same time, better varieties such 
as Norin 10 wheat, developed in Japan in the 1930s, or the dwarf wheat developed by Norman 
Borlaug in the Green Revolution, greatly increased yields.
In addition to gaps in farming system technology and knowledge, some large wheat grainproducing countries have significant losses after harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, 
inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmers' inability to bring the 
produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. Some 10% of total wheat 
production is lost at farm level, another 10% is lost because of poor storage and road networks, 
and additional amounts are lost at the retail level.
In the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, as well as North China, irrigation has been a 
major contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive 
increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in 
developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare. In developing countries, use of 
(mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on 
much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is 
Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300 
mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This is 
achieved by crop rotation with leguminous pastures. The inclusion of a canola crop in the 
rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%. In these low rainfall areas, better use of 
available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after 
harvesting and by minimizing tillage.
Pests and diseases
Pests – or pests and diseases, depending on the definition – consume 21.47% of the world's 
wheat crop annually.
Diseases
Rust-affected wheat seedlings
There are many wheat diseases, mainly caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Plant breeding to 
develop new disease-resistant varieties, and sound crop management practices are important 
for preventing disease. Fungicides, used to prevent the significant crop losses from fungal 
disease, can be a significant variable cost in wheat production. Estimates of the amount of 
wheat production lost owing to plant diseases vary between 10 and 25% in Missouri. A wide 
range of organisms infect wheat, of which the most important are viruses and fungi.
The main wheat-disease categories are:
Seed-borne diseases: these include seed-borne scab, seed-borne Stagonospora (previously 
known as Septoria), common bunt (stinking smut), and loose smut. These are managed with 
fungicides.
Leaf- and head- blight diseases: Powdery mildew, leaf rust, Septoria tritici leaf blotch, 
Stagonospora (Septoria) nodorum leaf and glume blotch, and Fusarium head scab.
Crown and root rot diseases: Two of the more important of these are 'take-all' and 
Cephalosporium stripe. Both of these diseases are soil borne.
Stem rust diseases: Caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (basidiomycete) fungi e.g. ug99
Wheat blast: Caused by Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum.
Viral diseases: Wheat spindle streak mosaic (yellow mosaic) and barley yellow dwarf are the 
two most common viral diseases. Control can be achieved by using resistant varieties.
A historically significant disease of cereals including wheat, though commoner in rye is ergot; it 
is unusual among plant diseases in also causing sickness in humans who ate grain 
contaminated with the fungus involved, Claviceps purpurea.
Animal pests

Among insect pests of wheat is the wheat stem sawfly, a chronic pest in the Northern Great 
Plains of the United States and in the Canadian Prairies. Wheat is the food plant of the larvae of 
some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including the flame, rustic shoulder-knot, 
setaceous Hebrew character and turnip moth. Early in the season, many species of birds and 
rodents feed upon wheat crops. These animals can cause significant damage to a crop by 
digging up and eating newly planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop late 
in the season by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in cereals 
amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and damage to wheat by 
various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception. Rodents can also cause major losses 
during storage, and in major grain growing regions, field mice numbers can sometimes build up 
explosively to plague proportions because of the ready availability of food. To reduce the 
amount of wheat lost to post-harvest pests, Agricultural Research Service scientists have 
developed an "insect-o-graph", which can detect insects in wheat that are not visible to the 
naked eye. The device uses electrical signals to detect the insects as the wheat is being milled. 
The new technology is so precise that it can detect 5–10 infested seeds out of 30,000 good ones.
Breeding objectives
In traditional agricultural systems, wheat populations consist of landraces, informal farmermaintained populations that often maintain high levels of morphological diversity. Although 
landraces of wheat are no longer extensively grown in Europe and North America, they continue 
to be important elsewhere. The origins of formal wheat breeding lie in the nineteenth century, 
when single line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted to 
have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed in the first years of the twentieth 
century and was closely linked to the development of Mendelian genetics. The standard method 
of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then 
selfing or inbreeding the progeny. Selections are identified (shown to have the genes 
responsible for the varietal differences) ten or more generations before release as a variety or 
cultivar.
Major breeding objectives include high grain yield, good quality, disease- and insect resistance 
and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral, moisture and heat tolerance. Wheat has 
been the subject of mutation breeding, with the use of gamma-, x-rays, ultraviolet light 
(collectively, radiation breeding), and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat 
created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them 
being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and 
zinc content has been developed through gamma radiation breeding, and through conventional 
selection breeding. International wheat breeding is led by the International Maize and Wheat 
Improvement Center in Mexico. ICARDA is another major public sector international wheat 
breeder, but it was forced to relocate from Syria to Lebanon in the Syrian Civil War.
Pathogens and wheat are in a constant process of coevolution. Spore-producing wheat rusts 
are substantially adapted towards successful spore propagation, which is essentially to say its 
R0. These pathogens tend towards high-R0 evolutionary attractors.
For higher yields
Breeding has increased yields over time
The presence of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop yields. Genes for 
the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by Japanese wheat breeders to produce Norin 10 short-stalked 
wheat, have had a huge effect on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors in the 
success of the Green Revolution in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by Norman Borlaug.
Dwarfing genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be diverted 
towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of lodging. "Lodging" occurs 
when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on the ground, and heavy nitrogenous 
fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow taller and become more susceptible to this problem.
By 1997, 81% of the developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving 
both increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer.
T. turgidum subsp. polonicum, known for its longer glumes and grains, has been bred into main 
wheat lines for its grain size effect, and likely has contributed these traits to Triticum 
petropavlovskyi and the Portuguese landrace group Arrancada. As with many plants, MADS-box 
influences flower development, and more specifically, as with other agricultural Poaceae, 
influences yield. Despite that importance, as of 2021 little research has been done into MADSbox and other such spikelet and flower genetics in wheat specifically.
The world record wheat yield is about 17 tonnes per hectare (15,000 pounds per acre), reached 
in New Zealand in 2017. A project in the UK, led by Rothamsted Research has aimed to raise 
wheat yields in the country to 20 t/ha (18,000 lb/acre) by 2020, but in 2018 the UK record stood 
at 16 t/ha (14,000 lb/acre), and the average yield was just 8 t/ha (7,100 lb/acre).
For disease resistance
Different strains have been infected with the stem rust fungus. The strains bred to be resistant 
have their leaves unaffected or relatively unaffected by the fungus.
Wild grasses in the genus Triticum and related genera, and grasses such as rye have been a 
source of many disease-resistance traits for cultivated wheat breeding since the 1930s. Some 
resistance genes have been identified against Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, especially races 1 
and 5, those most problematic in Kazakhstan. Wild relative, Aegilops tauschii is the source of 
several genes effective against TTKSK/Ug99 - Sr33, Sr45, Sr46, and SrTA1662 - of which Sr33 and 
SrTA1662 are the work of Olson et al., 2013, and Sr45 and Sr46 are also briefly reviewed therein.
Lr67 is an R gene, a dominant negative for partial adult resistance discovered and molecularly 
characterized by Moore et al., 2015. As of 2018 Lr67 is effective against all races of leaf, stripe, 
and stem rusts, and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis). This is produced by a mutation of two 
amino acids in what is predicted to be a hexose transporter. The product then heterodimerizes 
with the susceptible's product, with the downstream result of reducing glucose uptake.
Lr34 is widely deployed in cultivars due to its abnormally broad effectiveness, conferring 
resistance against leaf- and stripe-rusts, and powdery mildew. Krattinger et al. 2009 finds Lr34 
to also be an ABC transporter and conclude that this is the probably means of its effectiveness
and the reason that it produces a 'slow rusting'/adult resistance phenotype.
Pm8 is a widely used powdery mildew resistance introgressed from rye (Secale cereale). It 
comes from the rye 1R chromosome, a source of many resistances since the 1960s.
Resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB, Fusarium ear blight) is also an important breeding 
target. Marker-assisted breeding panels involving kompetitive allele specific PCR can be used. 
Singh et al. 2019 identify a KASP genetic marker for a pore-forming toxin-like gene providing FHB 
resistance.
To create hybrid vigor
Because wheat self-pollinates, creating hybrid seed to provide the possible benefits of 
heterosis, hybrid vigor (as in the familiar F1 hybrids of maize), is extremely labor-intensive; the 
high cost of hybrid wheat seed relative to its moderate benefits have kept farmers from adopting 
them widely despite nearly 90 years of effort. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been 
produced using chemical hybridizing agents, plant growth regulators that selectively interfere 
with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid 
wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States 
and South Africa.
Synthetic hexaploids made by crossing the wild goatgrass wheat ancestor Aegilops tauschii,
and other Aegilops, and various durum wheats are now being deployed, and these increase the 
genetic diversity of cultivated wheats.
For gluten content
Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten,
which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of breads and pastas from a 
functional point of view. However, a 2020 study that grew and analyzed 60 wheat cultivars from 
between 1891 and 2010 found no changes in albumin/globulin and gluten contents over time. 
"Overall, the harvest year had a more significant effect on protein composition than the cultivar. 
At the protein level, we found no evidence to support an increased immunostimulatory 
potential of modern winter wheat."
For water efficiency
Stomata (or leaf pores) are involved in both uptake of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere 
and water vapor losses from the leaf due to water transpiration. Basic physiological 
investigation of these gas exchange processes has yielded carbon isotope based method used 
for breeding wheat varieties with improved water-use efficiency. These varieties can improve 
crop productivity in rain-fed dry-land wheat farms.
For insect resistance
The gene Sm1 protects against the orange wheat blossom midge.
Genomics
Decoding the genome
In 2010, 95% of the genome of Chinese Spring line 42 wheat was decoded. This genome was 
released in a basic format for scientists and plant breeders to use but was not fully annotated.
In 2012, an essentially complete gene set of bread wheat was published. Random shotgun 
libraries of total DNA and cDNA from the T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS42) were sequenced 
to generate 85 Gb of sequence (220 million reads) and identified between 94,000 and 96,000 
genes. In 2018, a more complete Chinese Spring genome was released by a different team. In 
2020, 15 genome sequences from various locations and varieties around the world were 
reported, with examples of their own use of the sequences to localize particular insect and 
disease resistance factors. Wheat Blast Resistance is controlled by R genes which are highly 
race-specific.
Genetic engineering
For decades, the primary genetic modification technique has been non-homologous end joining 
(NHEJ). However, since its introduction, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool has been extensively adopted, 
for example:
To intentionally damage three homologs of TaNP1 (a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase 
gene) to produce a novel male sterility trait, by Li et al. 2020
Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici resistance has been produced by Shan et al. 2013 and Wang et al. 
2014 by editing one of the mildew resistance locus o genes (more specifically one of the 
Triticum aestivum MLO (TaMLO) genes)
Triticum aestivum EDR1 (TaEDR1) (the EDR1 gene, which inhibits Bmt resistance) has been 
knocked out by Zhang et al. 2017 to improve that resistance
Triticum aestivum HRC (TaHRC) has been disabled by Su et al. 2019 thus producing Gibberella 
zeae resistance.
Triticum aestivum Ms1 (TaMs1) has been knocked out by Okada et al. 2019 to produce another 
novel male sterility
and Triticum aestivum acetolactate synthase (TaALS) and Triticum aestivum acetyl-CoAcarboxylase (TaACC) were subjected to base changes by Zhang et al. 2019 (in two publications) 
to confer herbicide resistance to ALS inhibitors and ACCase inhibitors respectively
As of 2021 these examples illustrate the rapid deployment and results that CRISPR/Cas9 has 
shown in wheat disease resistance improvement.
In art
Wheatfield with Crows, an 1890 painting by Vincent van Gogh. Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam
The Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh created the series Wheat Fields between 1885 and 1890, 
consisting of dozens of paintings made mostly in different parts of rural France. They depict 
wheat crops, sometimes with farm workers, in varied seasons and styles, sometimes green, 
sometimes at harvest. Wheatfield with Crows was one of his last paintings, and is considered to 
be among his greatest works.
In 1967, the American artist Thomas Hart Benton made his oil on wood painting Wheat, showing 
a row of uncut wheat plants, occupying almost the whole height of the painting, between rows 
of freshly-cut stubble. The painting is held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
In 1982, the American conceptual artist Agnes Denes grew a two-acre field of wheat at Battery 
Park, Manhattan. The ephemeral artwork has been described as an act of protest. The 
harvested wheat was divided and sent to 28 world cities for an exhibition entitled "The 
International Art Show for the End of World Hunger".
